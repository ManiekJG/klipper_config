probe_nozzle_x: 269.3
probe_nozzle_y: 356.5


probe_switch_x: 264.5 # subtract ROUGHLY 3.75 from probe_nozzle_x to start
probe_switch_y: 337.2  # subtract ROUGHLY 19.25 from probe_nozzle_y to start


switch_offset: 0 # lower number = less squish
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..

max_deviation: 0.5
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.

#samples: 4
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: median
#   default from "probe:samples_result" section
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.

#clearance: default:2 * z_offset from the "probe:z_offset" section
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.

#position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.

speed: 200
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
#lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.

#probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: false
