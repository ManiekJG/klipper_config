[quad_gantry_level]
##  Use QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL to level a gantry.
##  Min & Max gantry corners - measure from nozzle at MIN (0,0) and 
##  MAX (250, 250), (300,300), or (350,350) depending on your printer size
##  to respective belt positions

fade_start: 0.21

#fade_target: 0
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#move_check_distance: 3
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
split_delta_z: 0.01
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#bicubic_tension: 0.2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
